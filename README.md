# Crypto Clustering

# Project Overview 
Use Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

# Requirements 
Python. 

# Visualizations and Analysis 

# Original Data

The best value for k is equal to 4 as that is where the "elbow" shape in the curve begins.

# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 

What is the total explained variance of the three principal components?

The total explained variance of the three principal components is 89.5%. 

What is the best k for the PCA?

The best value for 'k' when using the PCA data is still 4. It does not differ from the best k value found using the original data although the curves are slightly different. 

Cypto Clusters After PCA

The PCA model clusters is lower in intertia than the original. They are easier to distinguish the clusters in the PCA model although the data is much closer together. Overall, the clusters held the same coins even though 10% of the data was lost through this method it was still accurate.
